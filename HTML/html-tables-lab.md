## HTML Tables Lab

Using the `<table>` element and attributes, create a resume.



### The Set-Up

- Create a repository and call it  <em>“html-resume”</em> 

- Initialize the repository

- Clone locally and open repository in Visual Studio Code

- Create an HTML file called `index.html`

- Push up your changes to the remote repository


### The Task

We will use a table element to structure the layout of the Resume

In the resume.html file add a table. Your resume must have the following sections with content:

- Contact information

    - No phone numbers. Email address only
    - Do not include any social media if it is not professional

- Small summary 
    
    - A sentence that encapsulates you

- Skills

    - Skill acquire outside of school can be added as well

- Experience

    - Can be outside of school and work
    - Include any volunteer work
    - Participate in any clubs, organizations, or camps
    - Include summer jobs, whether with a company or working for yourself (ex: cutting grass, washing cars, etc.)

- Education

    - Schools attended including middle school


## Tips

- Use the `col` and `row` attributes to control the number of rows or columns you want to span.

- `<ul>` element can be used to list the items per section

- Look at other resumes for layout inspiration


>> Remember to stage, commit, and push your changes often. Let Git be on your team.
