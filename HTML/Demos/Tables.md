# Demo - HTML Tables

## Creating A Basic Table

- `<table>` element is a representation of data using a series of rows and columns.

    - There are no attributes for tables other than the global attributes such as `class`, `style`, `id`, etc.

    - Do not use the `<table>` element for laying out a webpage

- `<tr>` element specifies a row of cells in a table. A row can be filled with table cells and table header cells.

    - There is no element to define a column in a table. It is implied and is determined by the number of table cells inside a row.
    
    - No content or should be added inside of the element. The `<td>` element hold the data.

- `<td>` element defines a single table cell and contains data. This element should be nested within a `<tr>` element.
