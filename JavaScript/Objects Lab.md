## JavaScript Objects Lab

### Prerequisites
* JavaScript Fundamentals

### The Set Up
- You will need to fork and clone this repository.
- Change into the new directory.
- Create new file called `Prompts.JS`
- Copy and paste prompts into new file.
- Make sure to number the prompts you are answering in order to identify what is being answered.
- Complete the prompts below.
  
**Make one commit after each prompt you complete.**

### The Task
Take the following object:
```JS
const car = {
  make : "ford",
  model : "mustang",
  color : "black",
  type : "sedan",
  tires : "firestone",
  mode : "sport",
  gasoline : "super"
 }
```

#### Object Prompts

**Prompt 1:** Print the object above to the console.

**Prompt 2:** Write a function that takes an object as an argument and prints it to the console. 

**Prompt 3:** Delete the `gasoline` property from the object. Also print the object before or after deleting the property.

**Prompt 4:** Write a function that returns the object keys as an array.

**Prompt 5:** Write a function that returns the object's values as an array.

**Prompt 6:** Add two more properties to the object `tints: 33%` and `carplay: true`. Print to the console to make sure properties were added.

**Prompt 7:** Add a function called `startEngine` when called states "VROOM VROOM" and add a `turnOffEngine` function that when called states "car turned off".

**Prompt 8:** Write a loop that iterates through the above object's properties. **Hint:** You will need to turn the object into an array using 1 of 3 object methods in order to loop through it.  

**Prompt 9:** Create an object choosing one of the following `duck`, `eagle`, or `penguin`. Add an array to the object called `favoriteFood`, listing the 3-5 favorite foods of the bird. Provide the object with 4 key:value pairs, one of which being a boolean value named `canFly`. This object should contain 3 functions named `chirpSound`, `birdDiet`, and `fly`. The `fly` function must contain a conditional based on if the bird you chose can fly or not. If the bird can fly, the function when called will output `I live in the sky`, if not then the function will output `I'd like to stay on the ground`. 

**Prompt 10:** Create another object called `house` that contains the following:
* A total of 10 key value pairs.
* 2 of the values should be booleans.
* Should contain 1 array.
* Should contain 2 functions.
* 1 function should contain a conditional.
* At least 1 of the values should be an object that has 3 key value pairs.
