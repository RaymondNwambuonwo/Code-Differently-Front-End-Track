## JavaScript Numbers Drill



### The Set-Up

- Fork and clone this repository locally and in Visual Studio Code

- Create a JS file called `main.js`

- Push up your changes to the remote repository


### The Tasks

Using arithmetic operations and `Math` object and its methods, code statements to print the result to the terminal.

1. Prompt a user twice to input a number between 1 and 9. Store their response in variables.

    > Remember, their responses will be in the form of a string.

2. Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.

3. Declare another variable to store the total of each statement

4. Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.

5. Code a series of JS statements that use the user input to preform math operations. 

   Must use math operations: 

    - addition
    - subtraction
    - multiplication 
    - division
    - exponent
    - modulus

    Ex:

    ```javascript
    som = a + b;
    ```

6. Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.

7. Code a statement that would return a random number between 1 and 35. 

8. Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.

9. Code a statement to return a floating point number rounded up to the nearest integer.

10. Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.

11. Code a statement that returns a floating point number rounded down to the nearest integer.

12. Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.

13. Using `Math.pow` return the value of the one variable to the power of the other

14. Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.

15. Create another JS file and called it `bonus.js`. Go for it and try your best!!!

16. Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.

17. Debug and fix the code below. Analyze the code carefully to determine what it is supposed to do.

    ```javascript
    function squaed(b) {
        return a * a
    }
    ```
    - Examples of when the function is called with arguments:

    ```javascript
    squared(5) ➞ 25
    squared(9) ➞ 81
    squared(100) ➞ 10000
    ```

18. Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.

19. Using the `&&` operator, consider the following below:

    - Consider `a && b`

        - `a` is checked if it is `true` or `false`
        - If `a` is `false`, `false` is returned
        - `b` is checked if it is `true` or `false`.
        - If `b` is `false`, `false` is returned.
        - Otherwise, `true` is returned (as both `a` and `b` are therefore `true` ).

    Add code to the function below:

    ```javascript
    function and (a, b){

    }
    ```

    Examples  of the function when called with arguments:

    ```javascript
    and(true, false) ➞ false
    and(true, true) ➞ true
    and(false, true) ➞ false
    and(false, false) ➞ false
    ```

20. Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.

21. Given the inputs `true` and `false`, fix the code below:

    ```javascript
    function has_bugs(buggy_code) {
	if (buggyCode) {
		return 'sad days'
	} else if {
		return 'it's a good day'
	    }
    }
    ```

    Examples of the function being called with an argument:

    ```javascript
    has_bugs(true) ➞ "sad days"
    has_bugs(false) ➞ "it's a good day"
    ```

22. Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.

23. Given two integers, `a` and `b`, return `true` if `a` can be divided evenly by `b`. Return `false` otherwise.

    Use the code below to get started

    ```javascript
    function dividesEvenly(a, b) {
	
    }
    ```

    Examples when the function is called with arguments:

    ```javascript
    dividesEvenly(98, 7) ➞ true
    // 98/7 = 14

    dividesEvenly(85, 4) ➞ false
    // 85/4 = 21.25
    ```
24. Stage, commit, and push up your changes. Let Git be on your team.
