## JavaScript Loops Lab

### Prerequisites
* JavaScript Fundamentals

### The Set Up
- Create a repository and call it  <em>“JS Loops Lab”</em> 

- Initialize the repository

- Clone locally and open repository in Visual Studio Code

- Create an JS file called `main.html`

- Push up your changes to the remote repository


### The Task
Below are some prompts you will need to complete. You will also need to number the problems that you answer.

#### Loops
**Prompt 1:** Write a `for loop` that counts from 10 to 20, that prints each number to the console.

**Prompt 2:** Write a `for loop` that counts down from 40 to 0 that prints each number to the console.

**Prompt 3:**  Write a `for loop` that counts from 0 to 20 in increments of 2 that prints each number to the console.

**Prompt 4:** Write a `for loop` that counts from -15 to 15 that prints each number to the console.

**Prompt 5:** Create a variable called `answer` and define it outside of your loop. Create a loop that counts from 20 to 30, incrementing by 2. Add i to `answer`. After your loop, print the value of `answer` to the console.

**Prompt 6:** This will require you to create a loop that counts from 0 to 30. Place a conditional statement inside of your loop with the following: 
- If the value of `a` is even, print out "`a` is an even number".
- If the value of `a` is odd, print out "`a` is an odd number".

**Prompt 7:** Write a for loop that will iterate from 0 to 10. For each iteration of the for loop, it will multiply the number by 9 and log the result
