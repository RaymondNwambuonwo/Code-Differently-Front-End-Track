## JavaScript Functions Lab

### Prerequisites
* JavaScript Fundamentals

### The Set Up
- Create a repository and call it  <em>“JS Functions Lab”</em> 

- Initialize the repository

- Clone locally and open repository in Visual Studio Code

- Create an JS file called `main.html`

- Push up your changes to the remote repository


### The Task 
Below will be prompts you need to complete. You are to write the prompts as a traditional function and arrow function, this is to reinforce that you can do both. 

#### Function Prompts

**Prompt 1:** Write a function, using function keyword, named `greeting`. When invoked, `greeting` should print the string 'hey there'.

**Prompt 2:** Write a function that can reverse a number.

**Prompt 3:** Write a function that checks whether the passed string is palindrome or not?(A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward ex: madam)

**Prompt 4:** Create a function that returns a passed string with letters in alphabetical order. **Example** 
Example string : 'webmaster'
Expected Output : 'abeemrstw'

**Prompt 5:** Make a function that accepts a string as a parameter and converts the first letter of each word of the string in upper case. the second part of this prompt, change to lower case.(two functions in total) 

**Prompt 6:** Make a function that accepts a string as a parameter and find the longest word within the string. 

**Example:** "Welcome to the developmental shop provided by Code Differently". 


**Longest Word**: "developmental"


**Prompt 7:** Create a function that takes two parameters: a and b. When called, multiply a times b. Print the answer to the console.

**Prompt 8:** Create an object of your choosing and write a function that returns that object.

**Prompt 9:** Make an array of your choosing and write a function that returns the array.

**Prompt 10:** Write a function to find the repeated character in a string.

## Its "Funktion" Time!
**Choose 1 of the two below.**

**Create a Fortune Teller:**
  - Write a function named `tellFortune` that:
    - takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
    - outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
- Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.


**Create a Puppy Age Teller:**
