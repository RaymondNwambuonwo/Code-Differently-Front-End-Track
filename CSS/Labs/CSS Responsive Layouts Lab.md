##  Lab 2: CSS Responsive Layouts

### Prerequisites
* HTML Fundamentals
* CSS Fundamentals
* Completed Lab 1 CSS Basics

### The Set Up
* Open the previous web page you created in the “CSS Basics Lab”. 


### The Task
Continuing from the first lab and for you to demonstrate your newly acquired knowledge on CSS and HTML, we want you to take the mock website you created and make it responsive. You should know by now that responsive design means your site can be accessed and viewed on any device such as phones, tablets, and computers. 
Your web page must include the following:

* Media Queries
* Breakpoints
* Flexbox or Grid 

<!-- Possibly incorporate flex into the landing page -->

<!-- DEMO: CSS diner -->

<!-- CSS Flex frogger and Grid garden for turn and talks -->
