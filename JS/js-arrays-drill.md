## JavaScript Arrays Drills

These drills are to reenforce what you just learned about JavaScript arrays. 


### The Set-Up


- Create a repository and call it  <em>“js-arrays-drill”</em> 

- Initialize the repository

- Clone locally and open repository in Visual Studio Code

- Create an JS file called `main.html`

- Push up your changes to the remote repository



### The Task

1. Read the steps below and code 

    - Create an array named `songs` that contains five different names of songs as strings.

    - Access the first song in the array and print it to the console 

    - Now do the same with the *third* song in the list. 

    - Write one line of code that changes the value of the last song in the list to `"Happy"` (overwriting the previous value).

    - Create a new variable called `jamFour` and set it equal to the fourth song in the list.

    - Add another song to the end of the list.

    - Add another song to the *beginning* of the list.

    - Print the length of the array to the console 

    - Remove the last song from the end of list, and then print the length of the array to the console one more time.

    - Write a `for loop` to iterate through every song in the array and print each song's value to the console.

    - Copying from that loop you just wrote, modify it to print every song's value and every song's index in this format: `3, "Office Theme"` or `0, "Billy Jean"` etc.

    - Create a variable named `lastSong` that will always point to the last element of the `songs` array, no matter how many songs are in the list. 


2. Declare an array of at least 6 integers. Create a program that will sort the integer array in ascending and descending order.

3. Create a list of your favorite movies, music, or video games using a multidimensional array. 

    - First decide on the genres Ex: For movies - action, thriller, comedy. Need at least 3 genres.

    - Add titles to each genre. At least 4 titles/genre

    - Create a series of statements to access elements

        - Access the `second` element of the `third` array

        - Replace the `first` element of the `second` array with another

        - Using `for` loops, iterate through all arrays and print the elements to the console.
