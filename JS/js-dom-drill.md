## JavaScript and the DOM





### The Set-Up


- Create a repository and call it  <em>“js-dom-drill”</em> 

- Initialize the repository

- Clone locally and open repository in Visual Studio Code

- Push up your changes to the remote repository



### Tasks

#### Part One

1. Create an HTML file called `js-dom.html`

    - Must have global HTML document structure

2. Add two `<p>` elements without content. 

3. Give each `<p>` element an `id` and value

4. Create scripts for each exercise:

    - Write a script to add "We are coders!" to the `<p>` element.

    - Find the *first* `<p>` element and change its text to "Developers for life!"

    - Add an image to the HTML document using DOM methods

    - Write a script to change the color of the text from black to your favorite color

    - Add a script to change the font size of the first `<p>` element to `40px`

    - Add a button to the HTML document

    - Add a script that hides the image when the button is clicked


#### Part Two

1. Create an HTML file called `about.html`

    - Must have global HTML document structure

2. Creating a simple "About Me" webpage and using JS and the DOM to manipulate elements.

3.  Title your webpage *About Me* and add this code
```html
<ul>
    <li>Nickname: booboo</li>
    <li>Favorites: music, pizza, The Office</li>
    <li>Hometown: Wilmington </li>
    <li>Random Fact: Black is my favorite color.</li>
</ul>
```

4. Nest those values within a `span` element and give each an `id`

5. Create a JS file named `main.js` and link to the HTML document

6. Complete the following tasks below using the DOM methods:

    - Change the body style so it has a `font-family` of `Arial, sans-serif`.

    - Replace each of the values with your own information.

    - Change the `<li>` style to a color of your choosing. Cannot be black.

    - Find a picture and add to the project.

    - Create a new `img` element and set its `src` attribute to a picture of you. Append the image to the web page.
