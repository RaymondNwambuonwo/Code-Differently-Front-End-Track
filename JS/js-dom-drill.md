## JavaScript and the DOM





### The Set-Up


- Create a repository and call it  <em>“js-dom-drill”</em> 

- Initialize the repository

- Clone locally and open repository in Visual Studio Code

- Create an HTML file called `index.html`

    - Must have global HTML document structure

- Push up your changes to the remote repository



### The Tasks

1. Creating a simple "About Me" webpage and using JS and the DOM to manipulate elements.

- Title your webpage *About Me* and add this code
```html
<ul>
    <li>Nickname: booboo</li>
    <li>Favorites: music, pizza, The Office</li>
    <li>Hometown: Wilmington </li>
    <li>Random Fact: Black is my favorite color.</li>
</ul>
```

- Nest those values within a `span` element and give each an `id`

- Create a JS file named `main.js`

- Complete the following tasks below using the DOM methods:

    - Change the body style so it has a `font-family` of `Arial, sans-serif`.

    - Replace each of the values with your own information.

    - Change the `<li>` style to a color of your choosing. Cannot be black.

    - Find a picture and add to the project.

    - Create a new `img` element and set its `src` attribute to a picture of you. Append the image to the web page.
