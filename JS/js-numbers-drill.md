## JavaScript Numbers Drill



### The Set-Up

- Create a repository and call it  <em>“js-numbers-drill”</em> 

- Initialize the repository

- Clone locally and open repository in Visual Studio Code

- Create a JS file called `main.js`

- Push up your changes to the remote repository


### The Task

Using arithmetic operators, `Math` object, and methods, code statements to print the result to the terminal.

1. Prompt a user twice to input a number between 1 and 9. Store their response in variables.

    > Remember, their responses will be in the form of a string.

2. Declare another variable to store the total of each statement

3. Code a series of JS statements that use the user input to preform math operations. 

   Must use math operations: 

    - addition
    - subtraction
    - multiplication 
    - division
    - exponent
    - modulous

Ex:

```javascript
som = a + b;
```

4. Code a statement that would return a random number between 1 and 35. 

5. Code a statement to return a floating point number rounded up to the nearest integer.

6. Code a statement that returns a floating point number rounded down to the nearest integer.

7. Using `Math.pow` return the value of the one variable to the power of the other
